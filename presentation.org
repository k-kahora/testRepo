* What is emacs
** History

Its initial release was in 1985 by Richard Stallman

Its written in c and provides Emacs lisp the core language which is also written in c.

Emacs isn't really a text editor.  Its a complete lisp interpreter.  This what makes it so extensible.

* What its good at

- Its low on system resources
- Its highly extensible
- Keyboard only movement and interaction
  
* What its bad at

- Out of the box it looks terrible

- It takes a while to learn and is fundamentally different than most other workflows out there
- The main enticement is ccompleteky customizable to what your work flow is



* File management and display

Buffers are the core Emacs feature, a buffer is simply like a tab its a loaded file or process that is either being displayed or is not.

** Windows using windows you can make buffers display

- ~C-x 2~ to split horizontally and ~C-x 3~ to split vertically.
- ~C-x 0~ to kill window
- ~C-x 1~ to kill all windows except the one currently occupied.

** Modal editing

Major modes can be active for certain file types.  The current major mode can effect how text is interpreted and what keybindings will do what will do.  Foe example when running python you can use =python-mode=

** Its completely self documented

- ~C-h~ for all the documentation commands
- ~C-h k~ to look up a key binding
- ~C-h v~ to look up a
- ~C-h f~ to look up a function

  emacs is like playdoh you mold it into what you want
** The main feature is it's extensible

The behavior of emacs can be modified to almost no limit.  So many people have made refined packages and additions over the years.  There is a package for everything you could want.  And if there isn't you can make your own in emacs lisp
